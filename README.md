The reastauraunt buddy/food buddy app is an app to keep a list of restauruants you enjoy eating at 
If you are a new town or city that you are not familiar with you can do a restauraunt search and add search results to your favorites

Once you register and log in you can add favorites manually using a form on the home page
Alternatively you can go to the search page to enter a city in the search box to get a list of restauraunts in that city

If you click on a search result it will be removed from the search results and added to your favorites
favorites can be added manually or deleted from the home page

This project uses Python Flask SQLite and some JavaScript

The worldwide-restauraunts API is used to do restauraunt searches
